        <h2 style="text-align:center">A candidate for the people!</h2>
        <p><strong>Ollie-Bear has never told a lie!</strong></p>
        <p>You can count on what he says! Ollie doesn't flip flop on the issues, when he believes in something, he stands by it! Take a look at his views:</p>
        <h3>Health Care</h3>
        <p>It is very important to Ollie that everyone has access to good, affordable health care. He believes in immunizations to stop the spread of diseases. He also feels that a healthy diet and lots of exercise are critical. Ollie lives what he believes. <em>He is active and chasing a ball with his sister for two to three hours a day!</em></p>
        <p>Ollie wants everyone to eat their vegetables. In fact, he has been known to hand out raw sweet potatoes to the other dogs in the house. </p>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>Access to high quality obedience schools are very important to Ollie. No one should have to take out a loan for job training. Strong obedience skills are critical for job security.</p>
        <p><small>It is true that Ollie-Bear was home schooled as a pup, he believes in parental choice for schooling.</small></p>
        <h3>Foreign Policy</h3>
        <p>Ollie is a strong candidate on Foreign Policy. He has been in negotiations with the German Shepherd next door for the last few months.
            <mark>Negotiations have focused on territory disputes.</mark>
        </p>
        <p>Ollie believes that <q>good fences make good neighbors!</q></p>

        <h3>Climate Change</h3>
        <p>Ollie has a good understanding of climate <del>change</del>. In the summer, it is quite warm, and dogs should be provided with plenty of clean cold water. Baby pools filled from a cold hose are quite refreshing, and Ollie likes a summer fur cut. </p>
        <h3>The War on Drugs</h3>
        <p>While Ollie does not have any experience in the service, he is a big supporter of all dogs in uniform, and admires the job that they are doing to keep the streets and the country safe. <sub>He needs a good advisor on this one</sub></p>
        <h3>Taxes</h3>
        <p>Ollie believes
            <blockquote>
                Taking care of the country's dogs is a priority. No less than one percent of each individual's income should be taxed to make sure that no dog is left in the cold, no dog is hungry, no dog is denied medical care, and every dog is loved and cared for.
            </blockquote>

            <p><small>Ollie does need some work with math.</small></p>
